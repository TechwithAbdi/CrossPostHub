            4. Database and Security Policies
          </h2>
          <p>
            At CrossPostHub, we take your privacy and security seriously. To
            post on your behalf to platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn, we need
            to store your access tokens—this is a standard practice for apps
            that manage social media posting. We store these tokens securely in
            our database using industry-standard encryption, ensuring they’re
            protected from unauthorized access. We only use your tokens to
            perform the actions you’ve authorized (like posting or scheduling),
            and we never share them with third parties. You can revoke access at
            any time by disconnecting your account from our app, which will
            immediately remove your tokens from our system.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
            5. Subscription-Based Policies
          </h2>
          <p>
            CrossPostHub offers subscription plans to access premium features.
            Your payment information is collected and processed securely via
            trusted third-party payment processors. We do not store full payment
            details in our database—only necessary transaction data for billing
            purposes. You can cancel your subscription at any time through your
            account settings, and we will stop billing you at the end of your
            current billing cycle. Refunds are subject to our refund policy,
            available upon request.
          </p>
